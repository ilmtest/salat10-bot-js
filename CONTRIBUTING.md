# Development Guidelines & Style Guide

## General Guidelines

### Javascript

- Keep functions short
- Use `const` by default, only use `let` when you have to mutate

### React

- Keep logic out of React `render()` functions
- The React `render()` function should be the last function of the component

## Pull Request Reviewing Strategies

1. Take a look at the GitHub issue, read the description.
2. Try to understand the logic of the code and that it makes sense.
3. Ensure there are no typos in the code.
